# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project leverages **machine learning models** to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on key health metrics. It uses the popular **Pima Indians Diabetes dataset** and demonstrates a full ML pipeline — from data preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and predictions.
